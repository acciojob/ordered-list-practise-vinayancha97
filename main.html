	<p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>
    <ol>
		<li><p>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied</p></li>
		<li><p>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase itâ€™s total run time</p></li>
		<li><p>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms</p></li>
